### Higher-Order Spatiotemporal Correlations

* [Convolution goes higher-order: a biologically inspired mechanism empowers image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06740) - Submitted to NeurIPS 2025
  * Demonstrated that incorporating multiplicative interactions between filter outputs significantly improves performance on standard computer vision benchmarks
  * Developed a novel architecture that captures complex dependencies in visual data that standard CNNs miss

* [Higher-Order Convolution Improves Neural Predictivity in the Retina](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07620) - Submitted to CCN 2025
  * Extended the higher-order convolution framework to neural response prediction in the retina
  * Showed improved predictive performance while maintaining model interpretability



### Information Decomposition and Generative Models

* [What's Inside Your Diffusion Model? A Score-Based Riemannian Metric to Explore the Data Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11128) - Submitted to NeurIPS 2025
  * Introduced a mathematically rigorous framework for analyzing the geometry of visual representations using metrics derived from the score function in diffusion models
  * Exploited the Riemannian geometry of the learned image manifold to provide tools for understanding meaningful transformations in visual space

* [Decomposing stimulus-specific sensory neural information via diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11309) - Submitted to NeurIPS 2025
  * Established an axiomatic framework for pixel-wise and feature-wise information decomposition using score functions from diffusion models
  * Developed a novel plug-in conditioning method that eliminates the need for model retraining, making the approach computationally tractable for high-dimensional visual stimuli


### Equivariant Architectures for Visual Processing

* Scale-Equivariant Networks for Neural Response Prediction - In Progress
