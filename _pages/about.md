I am a Research Engineer in Brice Bathellier's Lab at the Hearing Institute in Paris, working on nonlinear network models for capturing the transformations that occurs accross the different stages of the auditory system. Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at CERN, under the supervision of Lorenzo Moneta, developing data conversion and visualization for the ROOT framework. Before that, I worked on nonlinear models of sequential spatial memory in Andr√© Longtin's Neurophysics and Nonlinear Dynamics group, at the University of Ottawa, co-supervised by Leonard Maler and Lamberto Rondoni. Besides that, I'm also the co-founder and president of the Machine Learning Journal Club (MLJC) a non-profit research organization, focused on interdisciplinary applications of Machine and Deep Learning, with a open-source attitude.
