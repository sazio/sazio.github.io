Salut! I am currently a Research Engineer in [Brice Bathellier's](https://www.bathellier-lab.org/people/Brice) Lab at the Hearing Institute in Paris, working on nonlinear network models for capturing the transformations that occurs accross the different stages of the auditory system. Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at CERN, under the supervision of [Lorenzo Moneta](https://root.cern/about/team/#Lorenzo%20Moneta), developing data conversion and visualization for the ROOT framework. Before that, I worked on nonlinear models of sequential spatial memory in [André Longtin's](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/alongtin/) Neurophysics and Nonlinear Dynamics group, at the University of Ottawa, co-supervised by [Leonard Maler](https://www.uottawa.ca/brain/people/maler-leonard) and [Lamberto Rondoni](~). 


I'm also the co-founder and president of the [Machine Learning Journal Club (MLJC)](https://www.mljc.it) a non-profit research organization, focused on interdisciplinary applications of Machine and Deep Learning, with an [open-source attitude](https://github.com/MachineLearningJournalClub). 

## Research Interests


I’m truly fascinated by **representation learning**, in particular by the idea of uncovering the underlying principles and symmetries, i.e. informative low dimensional geometrical structures, that allow for invariant and stable representations.

Given my background, at the intersection of experimental and theoretical Physics, I’m aware of the scientific paradigm as a fusion between experimental findings and theoretical perspectives. To characterize biological intelligence as a complex system, I aim to examine the transition between micro, meso and macro scales.
