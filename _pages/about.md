**Key Interests: Representation Learning, Biological Inspiration & Inductive Bias, Equivariant Representations, Vision**

Hello! I'm currently a PhD Candidate at the Vision Institute and Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, under the supervision of [Ulisse Ferrari](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=89XheA0AAAAJ&hl=it), [Olivier Marre](http://oliviermarre.free.fr/) and [Peter Neri](https://sites.google.com/site/neripeter/). My research interests revolve around uncovering the principles and symmetries that enable invariant and stable representations, with a focus on understanding biological learning, particularly in the context of vision. Specifically, I am investigating the invariance and equivariance properties of the retina to identify plausible low-level mechanisms and inductive biases relevant for segmentation at later stages. This forms the basis of my current project, and I am excited to explore this topic further üß†. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer in [Brice Bathellier](https://www.bathellier-lab.org/people/Brice)'s Lab at the [Hearing Institute](https://www.institut-audition.fr/en) (Institut Pasteur), focusing on nonlinear network models for the auditory system. I also spent a few months working at CERN (with [Lorenzo Moneta](https://root.cern/about/team/#Lorenzo%20Moneta)) and on nonlinear models of spatial memory at the University of Ottawa, under the supervision of [Andr√© Longtin](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/alongtin/) and [Leonard Maler](https://www.uottawa.ca/brain/people/maler-leonard).

Finally, I am the co-founder and member (ex-president) of a non-profit research organization, the [Machine Learning Journal Club (MLJC)](https://www.mljc.it), which focuses on interdisciplinary applications of Machine and Deep Learning. Through the MLJC, I have worked on scientific machine learning, brain-computer interfaces, and natural language processing, and I'm currently organizing a group on applications of geometric deep learning and the role of symmetries in the learning process. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:simone.azeglio@gmail.com) if you're interested in any of our MLJC projects or share similar interests.
